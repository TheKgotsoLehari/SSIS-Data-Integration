# SSIS Data Integration 


In this project, I worked with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to build a simplified yet effective ETL pipeline. Using only a flat file source and connecting it to an OLE DB Destination, I explored SSIS's data flow capabilities for transferring data from flat files directly into a database. This process helped me understand the foundational elements of SSIS while creating a reliable package that automated data loading into a data warehouse.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to build a straightforward ETL pipeline with SSIS to load data from flat files into a database using an OLE DB Destination. By focusing on a single-source, single-destination setup, I could concentrate on understanding SSIS's data flow features, ensuring data accuracy and transfer efficiency.
## Key Insights and Methods
- **Data Flow Setup:** In SSIS, I configured the data flow task to extract data from a flat file and load it into an OLE DB Destination, representing a simple ETL workflow.

- **Flat File Source:**  The flat file source was my primary data input, set up to read structured data from a CSV or similar flat file format.

- **OLE DB Destination:** I used the OLE DB Destination as the target for storing transformed data in a SQL Server database, ensuring compatibility and efficient data handling.
## Value and Output

This project demonstrated how SSIS simplifies data migration tasks even in basic ETL processes. The final output was a reliable SSIS package that effectively loaded data from flat files into a SQL Server database, making the data readily available for further analysis. This straightforward ETL setup is highly useful in scenarios where data needs to be periodically loaded from external sources into a database with minimal manual intervention.
